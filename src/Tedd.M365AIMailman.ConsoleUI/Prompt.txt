=== BODY END ===

Based on the content, decide the most appropriate action:
1. Move emails to a Specific Folder: If the email belongs in one of the following categories/folders: {DYNAMIC_FOLDER_LIST}. Use the 'MoveToFolderAsync' function, providing the EXACT folder name from the list above (e.g., '{DYNAMIC_EXAMPLE_FOLDER}' for a newsletter).
2. Emails about calendar invite, refund, pending payments, missing payment or renewals of subscriptions should not be touched.
3. Security related emails should not be touched.
4. No Action: If the email seems important, personal, work-related, take no action.

Execute the chosen function. If no action should be taken, respond with 'No action needed'.

To summarize:
* There are emails you should not touch. You need to identify them.
* There are emails you should move to a specific folder. You need to identify them.
